Because sometimes you just need some text and opening [hipsum.co](http://hipsum.co) takes too long.

## Install

npm install -g hipsum-cli
```

## Use
```bash
hipsum <paragraphs> # <paragraphs> is the number of paragraphs to generate
```

Paste that newfound hipsterness on that record store's website you're working on.
